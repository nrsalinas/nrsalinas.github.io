Hola. Welcome to my personal website.

Here you will find info about my research and academic activities. I am a botanist who has worked mostly on diversity, conservation, and evolutionary biology of Neotropical plants. However, during the last few years I have also become interested on biodiversity informatics and computational biology.

Currently, I am a data analyst at the [Jardín Botánico de Bogotá](https://jbb.gov.co/ "JBB"). 
Through this appointment, I am contributing to the design and establishment of a biodiversity monitoring program in Bogotá.
Prior to this appointment, I was a researcher at the [Instituto Humboldt](http://www.humboldt.org.co/en/ "Instituto Humboldt"), a data analyst at [IDEAM](http://www.ideam.gov.co/ "IDEAM") and the [Instituto Sinchi](https://sinchi.org.co "Sinchi"), and a postdoctoral fellow at the [American Museum of Natural History](https://www.amnh.org/about/gilder-center "AMNH") and the [New York Botanical Garden](https://www.nybg.org/plant-research-and-conservation/ "NYBG").

You can access my cv [here](nrsalinas_cv.pdf "Nelson Salinas CV").

## Research interests


__1. Neotropical plant diversity and systematics.__

Tropical forests are some of the most diverse, yet endangered, ecosystems on the planet. An strategy to tackle this problem is to gather basic biological information of organisms and ecosystems that are particularly affected by anthropogenic activities. I have worked on systematics of Bromeliaceae (pineapples), Costaceae (spiral gingers), and Ericaceae (blueberries), and conducted general diversity surveys in Amazonian, Andean, and Choco forests from my home country, Colombia. I have conducted most of this work with collaborators from the [Instituto de Ciencias Naturales](http://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/icn/ "ICN"), [Instituto Sinchi](http://www.sinchi.org.co/), and the [New York Botanical Garden](http://www.nybg.org/science-new/).

Relevant output:

- [Guide](Ericaceae_Narino.pdf "Las ericáceas de la vertiente pacífica de Nariño, Colombia") to the Ericaeae from W Nariño.

__2. Biogeography.__

Recognizing spatial patterns (biogeographic regions, areas of endemism, etc.) from geographic distributions of organisms is one of the main tasks of biogeography. However, biogeography has been marginalized from the statistical revolution that has recently transformed other subdisciplines of comparative biology. As a way to contribute towards such goals, I have worked on the implementation of a graphical statistical model (Hidden Markov Random Fields) to uncover areas of endemism from geographic distribution data.

Relevant output:

- [Statistical Modeling of Distribution Patterns: A Markov Random Field Implementation and Its Application on Areas of Endemism](Salinas_Wheeler_2020.pdf "HMRF article").
