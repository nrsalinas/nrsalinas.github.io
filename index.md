Hola. Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find info about my research interest and related topics. Although I have spent most of my career working on conservation, diversity, and evolutionary biology of Neotropical plants, I have become interested on biodiversity informatics during the last few years.

Currently, I am a Gerstner postdoctoral fellow at the American Museum of Natural History, working under the supervision of Ward Wheeler.
My postdoctoral project at the museum aims to implement graph statistical models to study patterns of geographic distributions among multiple organisms---that is, to delimit areas of endemism.

You can access my cv here.

### Research interest

__1. Neotropical plant diversity and systematics.__

Tropical forests gather some of the most diverse, yet endangered, ecosystems in the planet. An strategy to tackle this problem is to gather basic biological information of organisms and ecosystems that are particularly affected by anthropogenic activities. I have worked on systematics of Bromeliaceae, Costaceae, and Ericaceae, and conducted general diversity surveys in Amazonian, Andean, and Choco forest from my home country, Colombia.

__2. Biogeography.__

Recognizing spatial patterns (biogeographic regions, areas of endemism, etc.) from geographic distributions of organisms is one of the main tasks of biogeographic. However, biogeography has been marginalized from the statistical revolution that has recently transformed other subdisciplines of comparative biology. As a way to contribute towards such goals, I am currently working on the implementation of a kind of graphical statistical models (Hidden Markov Random Fields) to uncover areas of endemism from geographic distribution data.
